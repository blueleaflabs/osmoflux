    "Hydraulics (common assumption used here):\n",

    "\t•\tUpdate V_TERM_V by the external closure (fixed load or MPPT).\n",
    "\n",
    "Important caution:\n",
    "\t•\tBecause the model’s electrical degrees of freedom are larger than a standard stack, it can show behaviors that are artifacts for a single-electrode device (for example, multiple segments appearing “blocked” simultaneously under a high initial V_TERM_V).\n",
